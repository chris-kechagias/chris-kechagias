# Hi, I'm Chris 👋

## 🚀 Career Transition: Retail Manager → AI Engineer

Automation Engineer pivoting to AI/ML after 15 years in retail operations. Building production-ready AI applications and documenting the entire journey.

**Why AI?** Combining my 2012 engineering degree with 2010 AI thesis experience and 15 years of retail domain knowledge to solve real-world problems in inventory management, automation, and AI-powered systems.
