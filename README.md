# Hi, I'm Chris 👋

## 🚀 Career Transition: Retail Manager → AI Engineer

Automation engineer pivoting to AI/ML after 15 years in retail operations management. Building AI applications and documenting the journey from retail to engineering.

**Why this pivot?** Combining my 2012 engineering degree, 2010 AI thesis background, and 15 years of retail domain expertise to solve real-world problems in inventory management, automation, and AI-powered systems.

## 👨‍💻 Background

**Education:**
- B.Eng. Automation & Control Engineering, Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki (2012)
- Thesis (2010): Neural network-based computer vision system for citrus sorting using MATLAB

**Professional Experience:**
