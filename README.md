# Hi, I'm Chris 👋

## 🚀 Career Transition: Retail Manager → AI Engineer

Automation Engineer pivoting to AI/ML after 15 years in retail operations. Building production-ready AI applications and documenting the entire journey.

**Why AI?** Combining my engineering background with modern AI to solve real-world problems in retail, logistics, and automation.

## 👨‍💻 Background

**Education:**
- B.Eng. Automation & Control Engineering, University of Patras (2010)
- Thesis: Neural network-based computer vision system for citrus sorting
- Tech stack (2010): MATLAB, C++, Assembly, embedded systems

**Professional Experience:**
- 15 years in retail operations management
- Managed €2M+ inventory across multiple locations
- Led teams of 15+ people
- Identified countless automation opportunities (now building solutions for them!)

**The Gap:**
Spent 15 years applying problem-solving skills in retail. Now returning to engineering to build the AI systems that can transform the industry I know inside-out.
